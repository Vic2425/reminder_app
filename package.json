  "description": "The idea of creating a reminder app is for the pure purpose of reminding myself for things that has scheduled in different dates and times. Sometimes, our brains are too full to remember all the upcoming events in the near or far future, and the reminder app is one of our best friends which helps keeping things/lists in order and time. The best part is it can notice us ahead of time to prepare for the event, appointments, or even taking medicine, etc.\r ## Data categorize\r   *****\r   1. appUsers table",
